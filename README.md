# roll20-scripts
Storing my scripts and macros for enhancing the Roll20 Virtual Tabletop D&amp;D 5e experience.

The scripts and macros require a Pro Subscription from [roll20.net](https://roll20.net) in order to activate their API. They will also require some scripts to be installed, which will be expleained in detail below.

## API Script Requirements
The following API Scripts will need to be added to your game in order to run these scripts and macros:
- 5th Edition OGL by Roll20 Companion
- PowerCards
- Concentration
- TokenMod [ Need to call '!token-mod --config' and make sure "Players can IDs" is ON]
- ChatSetAttr
- Roll20 Audio Master [ call '!roll20AM --config' and make sure Access is "full" and import jukebox tracks to make them available to scripts.]
- AlterBars.js (Available here: https://gist.github.com/Sky-Captain-13/a503c35914644e6f885f170eaeedc705 )
- act.js (Available here: https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/6371080/turntracker1-spell-durations-and-effects/?pageforid=6371171#post-6371171 )

All but the last two are available in the Roll20 API Script Library dropdown for easy installation. Just find them in the dropdown and then click the 'Add Script' button. You might need to scroll a bit to find the button.
The other two you will need to browse to their linked pages and copy the scripts into new scripts in your game on Roll20. Click the 'New Script' link, enter the name of the script, then paste the code in the text area, then click the 'Save Script' button.
